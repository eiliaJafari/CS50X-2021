# Tic-Tac-Toe with tkinter and gui
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/T3EIYOZMRv0
#### Description:
Tic-tac-toe, or Xs and Os is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 table. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
I used tkinter Python library to create the GUI. Two options are available to play the game: Single-Player or Multiplayer.
Approach:
-	Create a menu containing selection buttons: Single-player or multiplayer.
-	Create a game-board containing nine tiles to play the game.
-	Allow the player to press the tile and check the status of the game
-	Display the message, who won the match.
Description of the functions:
gameboard_pc() and gameboard_pl() will create the geometry to play the game. It will add 9 buttons on 3×3 board of the game (Three rows of buttons containing three buttons each).
get_text_pc() and get_text() functions will put the text on buttons as it pressed.
pc() function will decide the next move of the system.
winner() function will check whether the player won the match or not.
isfree() function will check whether the player can choose the button or not.
isfull() function will check the board is full or not.
